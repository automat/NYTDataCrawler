(Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) Filled with wounded characters and hectoring spirits running loose in the desert Southwest, this novel revolves around a motherless 15-year-old girl who is an animal lover of the prickliest, most judgmental sort. The result is an ''odd, intelligent, unsettling and sometimes spectacularly uningratiating'' tale, Jennifer Schuessler said here last year. ''Williams's language runs with virtuosity across a wide range, from dead-on vernacular to gorgeously, unabashed oracular.'' LICKS OF LOVE: Short Stories and a Sequel, by John Updike. (Ballantine, $14.) The dozen stories here -- most about erotic memories -- share a theme of retrospect and a tone of forgiveness. A novella, ''Rabbit Remembered,'' brings readers up to speed with Harry Angstrom's family and relations, who gather for a dysfunctional Thanksgiving dinner to pay tribute to Updike's ''narcissistically impaired'' antihero. Last year in the Book Review, A. O. Scott praised ''the wry, measured sense of perspective'' the collection ''brings to Updike's earlier work,'' and the way ''his observations eddy and swirl into the mainstream'' of the novella, ''swelling it with life.'' HO CHI MINH, by William J. Duiker. (Theia/Hyperion, $16.95.) The author, a retired history professor and former Foreign Service officer in Saigon during the 1960's, spent 20 years reconstructing the life of the elusive leader who was the architect of Vietnamese independence. ''Duiker's magnificent . . . biography'' manages ''not only to fill in the missing pieces of Ho's life but to provide the best account of Ho as a diplomat and a strategist,'' Frances FitzGerald wrote here in 2000. PURGATORIO, by Dante Alighieri. Translated by W. S. Merwin. (Knopf, $19.95.) The middle part of ''The Divine Comedy'' may be short on the fire-and-brimstone atmospherics of ''Inferno,'' but this new translation, paired with the original Italian, reveals its subtler pleasures (like music and human emotion) as it follows Dante and Virgil on their tour of the mountain where souls destined for salvation purge their sins. '' 'Purgatorio' is a ravishing poem,'' Daniel Mendelsohn wrote here in 2000, and ''we should be grateful'' for Merwin's reverent version. WHAT REMAINS, by Nicholas Delbanco. (Warner, $13.95.) Flipping back and forth from the 1930's through the 1990's, this elegiac, deeply personal novel tracks the fortunes of a cultured Jewish family that escapes Nazi Germany and struggles to realign itself in London and America. The result is ''a work of wise maturity and limpid love,'' Catherine Lockerbie said in these pages last year. MY GOODNESS: A Cynic's Short-Lived Search for Sainthood, by Joe Queenan. (Hyperion, $14.95.) What happens when a notorious satirist with a withering mean streak tries to reinvent himself as a paragon of virtue and apostle of the ethically correct? Not surprisingly, he hits a few potholes on the path to niceness. ''Somewhere, Mencken is beaming,'' Bruce McCall wrote here in 2000. '' 'My Goodness' has to be the year's most sinfully rewarding guilty pleasure.'' ECHOES DOWN THE CORRIDOR: Collected Essays, 1944-2000, by Arthur Miller. (Penguin, $15.) The author of ''Death of a Salesman'' and ''The Crucible'' reflects on politics (including his long left-wing history), drama, intellectual life and the nature of evil, from the 17th-century Salem witch trials to Stalinism. ''Miller is hardly our leading optimist,'' Nora Sayre said in these pages last year. ''But he is an adventurous student of change, an unwavering dissident.'' IN SEARCH OF ISLAMIC FEMINISM: One Woman's Global Journey, by Elizabeth Warnock Fernea. (Anchor, $15.) The author, who spent two years traveling in the Middle East, reveals how feminism means different things to different people in the Muslim world but almost always involves tremendous survival skills. ''Fernea is a storyteller who captivates her reader with sights and smells and tastes,'' Elaine Sciolino said here in 1998. THE FAMILY ORCHARD, by Nomi Eve. (Vintage International, $13.) Set mainly in Israel, this first novel spans six generations of an earthy, passionate family and 160 years of Israeli history stretching back to Turkish-ruled Palestine in the 1830's. Last year our reviewer, Lore Dickstein, admired ''Eve's startling, imaginative and allegorical writing, which sparkles and surprises and never settles for the predictable.''

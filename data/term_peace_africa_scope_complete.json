                "byline": "By HENRY TANNER, Special to the New York Times) - Pope John Paul II declared today in his annual peace message that all people should strive to prevent every form of warfare. But he said that ''peoples have a right and even a duty to protect their existence and freedom'' against an unjust aggressor. The message - 21 pages long and addressed to individuals, heads of state and Government leaders the world over - was dated Dec. 8 and thus was written five days before Poland's rulers began their martial-law crackdown against the independent trade union Solidarity. Inalienable Rights Stressed The Pope made no reference to his Polish homeland, but Roman Catholic Church sources singled out the passage about the right of peoples to counter injustice and aggression as being particularly significant. In the official English version, the passage says: ''Christians, even as they strive to resist and prevent every form of warfare, have no hesitation in recalling that, in the name of an elementary requirement of justice, peoples have a right and even a duty to protect their existence and freedom by proportionate means against an unjust aggressor.'' In another passage the Pope warned that there could be no peace in a society in which the individual's inalienable rights were not respected. Such a society, he said, could ''not be at peace with itself'' and therefore could not contribute to building international peace. He emphasized that even local conflicts were often ''an expression of tensions originating elsewhere in the world'' and often had ''profound effects far from where they broke out.'' The same thought was reflected in his message Sunday in St. Peter's Square, when he thanked world public opinion for realizing that the problems of Poland were ''important to all nations and all societies, to Europe and to the contemporary world.'' The papal peace message, which is issued every year just before Christ-mas, has been an institution ever since Pope Paul VI some 10 years ago designated Jan. 1 as a day of peace. Today's message by John Paul was addressed also to the young, to men and women who bear responsibility for life in society and to families and teachers as well as to political leaders. It is being sent to government leaders everywhere. Warning against the ''the scandal of the arms race,'' the Pope called for international action for peace. While appealing to all individuals to do their part of the work for justice and peace, he urged them to ''realize that this work is something beyond human powers'' and can be done only with the help of God. Cautious Language on Poland In his public comments on the Polish situation, the Pope has used cautious language so far, but Vatican officials say he is deeply worried and saddened. One of the strongest expressions by the church here came in a front-page headline today in L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper, which read, ''Passive Resistance in Poland by the Working Class.'' The dispatch beneath the three-column headline was a summary based on official Polish declarations and reports by ANSA, the Italian news agency. The agency reported that 15 people arriving aboard Polish ships in Venice and in Savona, near Genoa, had requested political asylum in Italy. The defectors, the agency said, were seamen and their families as well as passengers. ANSA said other people, apparently crew members, had been held against their will aboard several Polish ships. ---- Pope to Visit Africa ROME, Dec. 21 (UPI) - The Vatican said today that Pope John Paul would visit Nigeria and Gabon during a trip of six or seven days to Africa in mid-February. It is to be his first trip abroad since he was shot during an appearance in St. Peter's Square on May 13. A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Romeo Panciroli, said that the Pope would visit Nigeria, where Roman Catholics account for about 6.5 percent of the population. ''A brief stop in Gabon is also foreseen,'' the spokesman added. The Vatican lists 66 percent of the population of Gabon as Catholic.",

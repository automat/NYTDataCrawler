If the United States is to strengthen its power . . . it must be prepared to play . . . through trade, aid, foreign investment, exchange of technology, measures to strengthen and stabilize the international monetary system - and its own economy. At the end of World War II, it was recognized that for the United States to achieve its international goals of rebuilding the world economy and preserving a secure structure of peace, high employment and economic growth would have to be maintained at home - to create the needed conditions for America's world role, to provide the resources needed by others, and to maintain an open and growing market for the goods of other countries. The world economic and financial crisis today requires a comparable effort on the part of the United States to keep its economy operating at a high level of employment, while curbing the inflation and high interest rates that have worsened the problems of others. International inflation stems from national sources, and the United States has been as great a culprit as any nation in breeding these evils. What is needed is the political courage, in the broad public interest, to curb the special- interest pressures that unbalance the budget, distort and waste national resources, including the arms race but by no means limited to the arms race.",
